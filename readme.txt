Raindrops Game:
-An array of raindrops and a catcher is established
-The catcher moves horizontally with the mouse, remains vertically in place
-The raindrops fall one at a time, every two seconds using a timer
-The objective is to catch each drop with the catcher
-If a drop comes into contact with catcher, the drop is sent to an off-screen location, stops moving, and score increases by one
-If the player misses a drop with the catcher and it reaches the bottom, it is moved off-screen, and lives decrease by one
-If the player loses all three lives, the game ends, with the option to start over available
-If the player gains a score of twnety, the player wins, with the option to play again available


Bugs:
-The area of the catcher that actually will react to a drop is off-center, drops pass through the right side of the image, even though it appears to touch
